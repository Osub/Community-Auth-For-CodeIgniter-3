Community Auth
##############

Community Auth is a user authentication application for CodeIgniter. It is completely unique, and not based on anyone's previous work. If you've come here looking for a CodeIgniter authentication library, then please keep in mind that Community Auth is more than just a library. Community Auth is distributed with example controllers, models, views, and should be considered a project foundation.
