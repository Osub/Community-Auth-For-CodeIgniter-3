* Blog post and/or docs to show ACL implementation:
	The idea here is that a user interface needs to be created to manage permissions.
	Each permission has a category name, and an action name.
	An interface would be created for user management, giving the admin the 
	ability to designate a user to have or not have permissions to take certain
	actions. When a user logs in, as long as "add_acl_to_auth_vars" is TRUE in the 
	authentication config, the user's specific ACL values are added 
	to the authentication variables, giving the dev a chance to check if 
	the user should have permission to take a specific action. If this is
	not done, then any call to Auth_model->acl_permits will get ACL then.
	ACL permissions are added to an array, where the category name and action 
	name are joined with a period. So for instance, if you have a category named 
	"general", and an action named "view_reports", and if the logged in user should 
	be able to take thataction, their ACL array would contain "general.view_reports".

	The whole idea of using an ACL allows for a finer control over users. In 
	my experience there are times when role based authentication can get messy 
	because there is a lack of user based ACL, and Community Auth needs it 
	to keep things clean and organized in larger sites. In a smaller site, it 
	would be entirely possible to use ACL instead of multiple roles.

	Because no ACL interface has been implemented, this really gives the developer 
	a chance to customize the way it is used. 

	If by default a user should have permission to do everything in a ACL category, 
	all they need is an ACL record "general.*" or "general.all". This kind of ACL
	record will keep the database super lean, and checking for permission as simple as:

		if( $this->acl_permits('general.view_reports') )
			// ... Do something ...

	If the user's ACL has "general.*", "general.all", or "general.view_reports" 
	then the acl_permits function would return TRUE.
